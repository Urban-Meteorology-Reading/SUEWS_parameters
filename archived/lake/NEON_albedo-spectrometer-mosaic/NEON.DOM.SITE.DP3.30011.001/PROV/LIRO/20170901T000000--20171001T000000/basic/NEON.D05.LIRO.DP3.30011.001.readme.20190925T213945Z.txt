DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION
------------------------

ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP3.30011.001

Name: Albedo - spectrometer - mosaic

Description: Total amount of solar radiation in the 0.4 to 2.5 micron band reflected by the Earth’s surface into an upward hemisphere divided by the total amount incident from this hemisphere

NEON Science Team Supplier: AOP

Abstract: Albedo, the ratio of a surface’s reflected energy to its incident energy, is an important measurement for characterizing earth system energy balance. Light and dark surfaces correspond to high and low albedo, respectively. An opaque surface’s difference in energy reflected as compared to the energy incident on it is absorbed by the surface, increasing its temperature. (Sabins, Jr., 1978). Albedo values depend on wavelength, illumination sources and geometry, sensor viewing geometry, reflectance as a function of angle and wavelength, as well as the scattering, absorbing, and re-radiating effects of the atmosphere. These factors are modeled/accounted for to best approximate a bi-hemispherical reflectance as would be measured in a laboratory setting. To this end, the wavelength-integrated surface reflectance, weighted with the global flux on the ground, is produced as the best practically achievable albedo measurement. (Richter & Schlapfer, 2017) L3 Albedo is distributed in 1km tiles created by taking the most-nadir pixels from the clearest flightlines acquired for each pixel.

Latency:
AOP data will be available 60 days after the final collection day at a site. AOP legacy data (those collected in 2013 through 2016) currently has partial availability, and will be completely available by April of 2019.

Brief Design Description: Albedo data products are derived from NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) Imaging Spectrometer (NIS) data collected in North-South oriented flight lines to reduce BRDF effects. These data are processed to orthorectified directional surface reflectance and then to Albedo as best practically approximated by wavelength-integrated surface reflectance, weighted with the global flux on the ground. L3 Albedo is distributed in 1 km square tiles with 1 m pixels.

Brief Study Area Description: NEON AOP data are planned for yearly collects at all NEON sites at 90% of maximum greenness or greater. Coverage is planned to include at least 95% of NIS Tower Airshed area as well as at least 80% of a minimum 10km x 10 km box around that. All acquisitions are subject to change due to weather conditions as well as program planning changes.

DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING
---------------------------

The data contained in this file are considered provisional. Updates to the data, QA/QC and/or processing algorithms over time will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed. 
 
Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing the entire AOP archive as advances in algorithms and processing technology are incorporated. This will typically occur in the northern winter months, between flight season peaks, and will be on the order of every 3 to 5 years in frequency.
