DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION
------------------------

ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.20004.001

Name: Barometric pressure above water on-buoy

Description: Barometric pressure, available as one- and thirty-minute averages for both station pressure and pressure reduced to sea level. Observations are made on the meteorology station on the buoy in lakes and rivers.

NEON Science Team Supplier: AIS

Abstract: Barometric pressure on buoys is measured every minute and is reported as 1-minute instantaneous measurements and 30-minute mean values. Other than the data collection frequency, this data product has the same data streams and processing as barometric pressure measured at aquatic met stations.

Latency:
Data collected in any given month are published during the second full week of the following month.

Brief Design Description: The buoys are comprised of sensor sets which measure meteorological parameters over a water surface along with submerged sensors that measure physical and chemical parameters of the water body. Some of these sensors are unique to the buoy subsystem and others are shared with other NEON subsystems, such as the wadeable stream sensor sets or terrestrial towers. Due to power, space, and data storage constraints on the buoy, the configuration of sensors deployed on a buoy may be different than those in other parts of NEON.

Brief Study Area Description: Buoys will be deployed at allÂ lake and large river sites within NEON.

Sensor(s): Vaisala - BAROCAP Digital Barometer PTB330

Keywords: buoy, meteorological station, rivers, met station, metabolism, lakes, aquatic, barometric pressure, atmospheric pressure

FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS
-----------------------

NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via the data portal or the API.

NEON instrumented systems (IS) data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.HOR.VER.TMI.DESC.YYYY-MM.PKGTYPE.GENTIME.csv

The definitions of component abbreviations are below. See NEON.DOC.002651: NEON Data Product Numbering Convention, located at http://data.neonscience.org/documents for more information.

General conventions, used for all data products:
   NEON: denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI.

   DOM: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 - D20).

   SITE: a four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code.

   DPL: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to data product processing level;

   PRNUM: a five-character numeric code, referring to the data product number (see the Data Product Catalog at http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-catalog).

   REV: a three-digit designation, referring to the revision number of the data product. The REV value is incremented by 1 each time a major change is made in instrumentation, data collection protocol, or data processing such that data from the preceding revision is not directly comparable to the new.

   HOR: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one horizontal plane. For example, if five surface measurements were taken, one at each of the five soil array plots, the number in the HOR field would range from 001-005. 

   VER: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one vertical plane. For example, if eight air temperature measurements are collected, one at each tower vertical level, the number in the VER field would range from 010-080. If five soil temperature measurements are collected below the soil surface, the number in the VER field would range from 501-505. 

   TMI: a three-character designation, referring to the temporal representation, averaging period, or coverage of the data product (e.g., minute, hour, month, year, sub-hourly, day, lunar month, single instance, seasonal, annual, multi-annual). 000 = native resolution, 001 = native resolution (variable or regular) or 1 minute, 002 = 2 minute, 005 = 5 minute, 015 = 15 minute, 030 = 30 minute, 060 = 60 minutes or 1 hour, 100 = approximately once per minute at stream sites and once every 5-10 minutes at buoy sites (lakes/rivers), 101-103 = native resolution of replicate sensor 1, 2, and 3 respectively, 999 = Sensor conducts measurements at varied interval depending on air mass, 01D = 1 day, 01M = 1 month, 01Y = 1 year.

   DESC: an abbreviated description of the data file or table.

   YYYY-MM: the year and month of the data in the file.

   PKGTYPE: the type of data package downloaded. Options are 'basic', representing the basic download package, or 'expanded',representing the expanded download package (see more information below).

Time stamp conventions:
   YYYY: Year
   YY: Year, last two digits only
   MM: Month: 01-12
   DD: Day: 01-31
   T: Indicator that the time stamp is beginning

CHANGE LOG
----------

Issue Date: 2019-02-19
Issue: Incorrect calibration information was applied to data.
       Date Range: 2018-01-01 to 2018-10-31
       Location(s) Affected: All locations.
Resolution Date: 2019-02-19
Resolution: Data reprocessed with correct calibration information.

Issue Date: 2019-06-13
Issue: The quality flags for corPresDewPtQF and corPresTempQF outputs were erroneously set.
       Date Range: 2018-01-01 to 2019-05-31
       Location(s) Affected: All locations.
Resolution Date: 2019-06-13
Resolution: The code was changed to resolve this issue and data were reprocessed.  Fewer outputs for corPres are expected to be flagged by corPresDewPtQF, corPresTempQF, and corPresFinalQF due to this change.

Issue Date: 2019-07-17
Issue: Incorrect calculations were applied to previously published data for the buoy station pressure corrected to sea level (corPres). For sites with both an inlet and outlet, when only one of inlet or outlet was available, the elevation was erroneously divided by two, resulting in incorrect corPres. When neither was available, the corPres term was still calculated using an elevation of 0.7 m.
       Date Range: 2018-01-01 to 2019-06-30
       Location(s) Affected: All locations
Resolution Date: 2019-07-17
Resolution: The calculation code was modified to fix corPres calculations and all data were reprocessed. The code has been modified to: (1) not divide the surface water elevation by two when only one of the inlet or outlet data streams are available, and (2) produce no corPres output when neither are available.

The Valid Calibration Flag is currently blank, but will be incorporated in future updates to this data product.

DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING
---------------------------

The data contained in this file are considered provisional. Updates to the data, QA/QC and/or processing algorithms over time will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed. 
 
Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing the entire AOP archive as advances in algorithms and processing technology are incorporated. This will typically occur in the northern winter months, between flight season peaks, and will be on the order of every 3 to 5 years in frequency.
