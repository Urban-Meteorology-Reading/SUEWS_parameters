# SUEWS_parameters
Methods to calculate SUEWS related parameters

Currently investigated:

- Parameters related to LAI for vegetated surfaces
- Parameters related to Albedo for vegetated surfaces
- Parameters related to Surface Conductance for vegetated surfaces (g1-g6)- For these parameters, refer to https://github.com/Urban-Meteorology-Reading/gs-calibration (it needes to be merged to this repo)
