DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION
------------------------

ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.20016.001

Name: Elevation of surface water

Description: Measurements of water surface elevation, available as one-, five-, and thirty-minute  averages in lakes and wadeable streams. Based on sensor measurements of water pressure.

NEON Science Team Supplier: AIS

Abstract: Surface water elevation is controlled by precipitation at both the landscape and channel scales, overland flow, interflow and groundwater flow. It is correlated to discharge and is critical to understanding how water moves through the environment, carrying nutrients and sediment, modulating aquatic ecosystem structure and function. This data product contains continuous, quality-controlled, surface water depth converted to elevation above mean sea level. Measurements are captured once per minute and reported as 1-minute instantaneous measurements and 30-minute averages.

Latency:
Data collected in any given month are published during the second full week of the following month.

Brief Design Description: Elevation of surface water will be used to provide continuous discharge measurements in wadeable streams, rivers and lakes where flowing inlet and outlet streams are present. Pressure transducers will be placed at both the upstream and downstream sensor stations in wadeable streams, at a single station in rivers and at the inlet and outlet locations of lake sites.

Brief Study Area Description: Elevation of surface water is measured at all aquatic sites. It is measured at the upstream and downstream sensor stations in wadeable streams; at a single station in rivers and at the inlet and outlet of lake sites.

Sensor(s): In-Situ, Inc. - Level TROLL 500

Keywords: elevation of surface water, discharge, e-stage, surface water, nutrients, water quality, metabolism, flux, stage, flow, surface water depth

FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS
-----------------------

NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via the data portal or the API.

NEON instrumented systems (IS) data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.HOR.VER.TMI.DESC.YYYY-MM.PKGTYPE.GENTIME.csv

The definitions of component abbreviations are below. See NEON.DOC.002651: NEON Data Product Numbering Convention, located at http://data.neonscience.org/documents for more information.

General conventions, used for all data products:
   NEON: denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI.

   DOM: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 - D20).

   SITE: a four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code.

   DPL: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to data product processing level;

The REV value is incremented by 1 each time a major change is made in instrumentation, data collection protocol, or data processing such that data from the preceding revision is not directly comparable to the new.

   HOR: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one horizontal plane. For example, if five surface measurements were taken, one at each of the five soil array plots, the number in the HOR field would range from 001-005. 

   VER: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one vertical plane. For example, if eight air temperature measurements are collected, one at each tower vertical level, the number in the VER field would range from 010-080. If five soil temperature measurements are collected below the soil surface, the number in the VER field would range from 501-505. 

   TMI: a three-character designation, referring to the temporal representation, averaging period, or coverage of the data product (e.g., minute, hour, month, year, sub-hourly, day, lunar month, single instance, seasonal, annual, multi-annual). 000 = native resolution, 001 = native resolution (variable or regular) or 1 minute, 002 = 2 minute, 005 = 5 minute, 015 = 15 minute, 030 = 30 minute, 060 = 60 minutes or 1 hour, 100 = approximately once per minute at stream sites and once every 5-10 minutes at buoy sites (lakes/rivers), 101-103 = native resolution of replicate sensor 1, 2, and 3 respectively, 999 = Sensor conducts measurements at varied interval depending on air mass, 01D = 1 day, 01M = 1 month, 01Y = 1 year.

   DESC: an abbreviated description of the data file or table.

   YYYY-MM: the year and month of the data in the file.

   PKGTYPE: the type of data package downloaded. Options are 'basic', representing the basic download package, or 'expanded',representing the expanded download package (see more information below).

DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING
---------------------------

The data contained in this file are considered provisional. Updates to the data, QA/QC and/or processing algorithms over time will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed. 
 
Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing the entire AOP archive as advances in algorithms and processing technology are incorporated. This will typically occur in the northern winter months, between flight season peaks, and will be on the order of every 3 to 5 years in frequency.
